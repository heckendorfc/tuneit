tuneit -- A simple command-line instrument tuner for OSS, ALSA and JACK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:

Tune-It is a very simple command-line based instrument tuner.

It uses two different algorithms for pitch detection.  By default,
a simple and fast Schmitt Trigger based algorithm is used to detect
the fundamental frequency of an instrument.  For better and more reliable
results, there is an alternative FFT based algorithm which is much more CPU
intensive.

As audio capture backends OSS, ALSA and JACK are supported.  By default,
tuneit will try to use the hw:0,0 ALSA device.

To build/install:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	make install


Options:

tuneit [OPTIONS...] [captureDevice]
Valid options:
	-f		Use the more CPU intensive FFT based algorithm
	-i		List available input ports and exit
	-o		Use OSS as the audio transport system
	-a		Use ALSA as the audio transport system
	-j		Use JACK as the audio transport system
	-l LATENCY	Measurement window size in 1/N seconds (default is 10)
	-r RATE		Set desired ALSA sample rate (default is 48000)
	-t HERTZ	Tune the A note of the scale (default is 440.0)
